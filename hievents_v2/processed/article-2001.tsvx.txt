0 Police in Mogadishu arrested a man who triggered explosion after being allowed back to his vehicle Somali police appeared to make a deadly error when they returned a suspected suicide car bomber they had arrested to his vehicle, where he then detonated a blast that killed four people, officials and witnesses have said.
1 Ali Muse, the head of the city's ambulance service, said the blast killed three civilians, while shopkeeper Abdiqadir Abdulahi said he saw one dead policeman as well.
2 Al-Shabab militants have stepped up a campaign of roadside bombs and suicide car bomb attacks in Mogadishu in recent weeks.
3 The militants were almost entirely pushed out of the Somali capital earlier this year in an offensive by African Union forces.
4 The latest blast, which happened on Tuesday near the former Egyptian embassy, sent a plume of smoke over the city and the remains of the car burned long after the explosion.
5 A policeman, Abdi Hassan, said the would-be bomber was intercepted hours before the blast and arrested.
6 But Hassan said police returned the attacker to his bomb-laden vehicle under orders to disarm the explosives.
7 Instead, he was able to trigger the bomb.
